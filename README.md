# Big City Weather App
Basic weather application built using Weatherstack API. 

Weatherstack dashboard: https://weatherstack.com/dashboard 
Weatherstack docs: https://weatherstack.com/documentation

## How to use
1. Clone the repository to download the files
2. Create an account on Weatherstack API to receive your access key
3. In `script.js`, paste your access key in place of `API_ACCESS_KEY` (WARNING: do not publish the key to the internet, use .env files to protect your API key. This is just for testing.)
4. Run the HTML in a live server and search for a major city
5. The result should be returned on the screen

## What I learned
- How to invoke an API using an API Key
- Working with the Weatherstack API to see the returned JSON object and pull data from it
- HTML elements contain whitespace when they are empty, but have opening and closing elements on different lines
